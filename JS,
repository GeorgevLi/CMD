JS,

http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch16.html
add(); // 1
add(); //1

but using closure will be working well.

var add = (function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {return counter += 1;}
})();

add(); //1
add(); //2
add(); //3
// the counter is now 3


1. dollar sign in js and jquery
 it commonly appears in variable definition and function calls. it is nothing mysterious about it as it is just a variable name.
 Internally, it is just a function or an alpha-numeric variable reference.
 but is the ECMAScript 6, it represent a Template Literal

In your example the $ has no special significance other than being a character of the name.

var user = 'Bob'
console.log(`We love ${user}.`); //Note backticks

 and in Jqery, it is used to distinguse JQUERY object from javascript object.
10. this
Question: What the heck is this in JavaScript?

Answer: At the time of execution of every function, JavaScript engine sets a property to the function called this which refer to the current execution context. this is always refer to an object and depends on how function is called. There are 7 different cases where the value of this varies.

In the global context or inside a function this refers to the window object.
Inside IIFE (immediate invoking function) if you use "use strict", value of this is undefined. To pass access window inside IIFE with "use strict", you have to pass this.
While executing a function in the context of an object, the object becomes the value of this
Inside a setTimeout function, the value of this is the window object.
If you use a constructor (by using new keyword) to create an object, the value of this will refer to the newly created object.
You can set the value of this to any arbitrary object by passing the object as the first parameter of bind, call or apply
For dom event handler, value of this would be the element that fired the event


Pass by value or by reference
Question: Does JavaScript pass parameter by value or by reference?

Answer: Primitive type (string, number, etc.) are passed by value and objects are passed by reference. If you change a property of the passed object, the change will be affected. However, you assign a new object to the passed object, the changes will not be reflected.


var num = 10,
    name = "Addy Osmani",
    obj1 = {
      value: "first value"
    },
    obj2 = {
     value: "second value"
    },
    obj3 = obj2;
 
function change(num, name, obj1, obj2) {
    num = num * 10;
    name = "Paul Irish";
    obj1 = obj2;
    obj2.value = "new value";
}
 
change(num, name, obj1, obj2);
 
console.log(num); // 10
console.log(name);// "Addy Osmani"
console.log(obj1.value);//"first value"
console.log(obj2.valuee);//"new value"
console.log(obj3.valuee);//"new value"

In JQuery:
$() is shorthand for JQuery()

SQL  Query:

1. right join vs right out join
        table left table right
    - right join performs a join starting from right-most
    - returns all records from right table, and matched records form left
    - result is NULL from left side if there is no match
    - right join and right out join are same
2. full join vs union
    - full join returns all matching records from both tables whether the other matches or not
    - full join  and full outer join are same
3. left joing vs left out join
    - left join performs a join starting from left-most
    - returns all records from left table, and matched records from the right.
    - result is NULL from right side if there is no match

 4. Inner join 
    - return all records that are matching value in both tables
