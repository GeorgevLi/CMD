JS,

http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch16.html
add(); // 1
add(); //1

but using closure will be working well.

var add = (function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {return counter += 1;}
})();

add(); //1
add(); //2
add(); //3
// the counter is now 3


1. dollar sign in js and jquery
 it commonly appears in variable definition and function calls. it is nothing mysterious about it as it is just a variable name.
 Internally, it is just a function or an alpha-numeric variable reference.
 but is the ECMAScript 6, it represent a Template Literal

In your example the $ has no special significance other than being a character of the name.

var user = 'Bob'
console.log(`We love ${user}.`); //Note backticks

 and in Jqery, it is used to distinguse JQUERY object from javascript object.
10. this
Question: What the heck is this in JavaScript?

Answer: At the time of execution of every function, JavaScript engine sets a property to the function called this which refer to the current execution context. this is always refer to an object and depends on how function is called. There are 7 different cases where the value of this varies.

In the global context or inside a function this refers to the window object.
Inside IIFE (immediate invoking function) if you use "use strict", value of this is undefined. To pass access window inside IIFE with "use strict", you have to pass this.
While executing a function in the context of an object, the object becomes the value of this
Inside a setTimeout function, the value of this is the window object.
If you use a constructor (by using new keyword) to create an object, the value of this will refer to the newly created object.
You can set the value of this to any arbitrary object by passing the object as the first parameter of bind, call or apply
For dom event handler, value of this would be the element that fired the event


Pass by value or by reference
Question: Does JavaScript pass parameter by value or by reference?

Answer: Primitive type (string, number, etc.) are passed by value and objects are passed by reference. If you change a property of the passed object, the change will be affected. However, you assign a new object to the passed object, the changes will not be reflected.


var num = 10,
    name = "Addy Osmani",
    obj1 = {
      value: "first value"
    },
    obj2 = {
     value: "second value"
    },
    obj3 = obj2;
 
function change(num, name, obj1, obj2) {
    num = num * 10;
    name = "Paul Irish";
    obj1 = obj2;
    obj2.value = "new value";
}
 
change(num, name, obj1, obj2);
 
console.log(num); // 10
console.log(name);// "Addy Osmani"
console.log(obj1.value);//"first value"
console.log(obj2.valuee);//"new value"
console.log(obj3.valuee);//"new value"

In JQuery:
$() is shorthand for JQuery()


JaveScript tips:

The shortcutting in Js logical "OR:
 to set default values, instead of this:

function documentTitle(theTitle)
​if (!theTitle) {
  theTitle  = "Untitled Document";
  }
}

use this:

function documentTitle(theTitle)
  theTitle  = theTitle || "Untitled Document";
}

note:
- first the || operator first evaluates the expression on the left, if it is truthy, it will return the value. otherwise, it will return the evaluated value of the left.
- Javascript falsy values: null,false,0,undefined,NaN,and ""(empty string)
Instead of this:
var userID;
​if (userName && userName.loggedIn) {
  userID = userName.id;
}
​else {
  userID = null;
}

use:
var userID = userName && userName.loggedIn && userName.id
- if userName is truthy, call userName.loggedin and check if it is truthy;if it is truthy, then get the id from userName.
- if userName is falsy, return null

The shortchutting in js Logical "AND"
instead of this:

function isAdult(age) {
  if (age && age > 17) {
        return true;
  }​else {
    return false;
  }
}

use:
function isAdult(age) {
   return age && age > 17 ;
}

Expanation:
- The && operator first evaluates teh expression on the left. If it is falsy, false is returned; it does not bother to evaluate the right operand
- if the first expression is truth, also evaluated the right operand and return the result

Go further:

instead of this:
if (userName) {
  logIn (userName);
}
 else {
   signUp ();
}

use this:
userName && logIn (userName) || signUp ();

NOte:
Explanation:
— If userName is truthy, then call the logIn function with userName as the parameter.
— If userName is falsy, call the signUp function

POWERFUL USES OF IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS
(How immediatedly invoke Function expression and when to use them)
IIFE (pronounced “Iffy”) is an abbreviation for Immediately Invoked Function Expression, and the syntax looks like this:
(function () {
 // Do fun stuff​
 }
)()
 it is an anonymous functions expression that is immediatedly invoked, and it has some particularly uses in Javascript

 Similarly, we can even created a named, immediately invoked functions expression:

 (showName = function (name) {console.log(name || "No Name")}) (); // No Name​
​
showName ("Rich"); // Rich​
showName (); // No Name

when to use iife:
1. avoid declaring variables in the globle scope
2. use an iiffe in the top level of your application
3. keep the defined variables to shadow the already defined variable with the same name.

--- first example
 // All the code is wrapped in the IIFE​
(function () {
    var firstName = “Richard”;
    function init () {
            doStuff (firstName);
            // code to start the application​
    }
    ​​function doStuff () {
          // Do stuff here​
    }
                ​
    ​function doMoreStuff () {
         // Do more stuff here​
    }
    // Start the application
    init ();
}) (passedinparameters);
--- second example

Use it in Closures to Prevent Fold Over
- To prevent close over in for loops, we can use an Immediately Invoked Function Expression to prevent a common bug when closures are used with for loops:
To fix side effects (bug) in closures, you can use an IIFE, such as if this example:

function celebrityIDCreator (theCelebrities) {
    var i;
    var uniqueID = 100;
    for (i = 0; i < theCelebrities.length; i++) {
        theCelebrities[i]["id"] = function (j)  { // the j parametric variable is the i passed in on invocation of this IIFE​
            return function () {
                return uniqueID + j; 
                // each iteration of the for loop passes the current value of i into this IIFE and it saves the correct value to the array​
            }
        } (i); // immediately invoke the function passing the i variable as a parameter​
    }
​
    return theCelebrities;
}
​
​var actionCelebs = [{name:"Stallone", id:0}, {name:"Cruise", id:0}, {name:"Willis", id:0}];
​
​var createIdForActionCelebs = celebrityIDCreator (actionCelebs);
​
​var stalloneID = createIdForActionCelebs [0];
console.log(stalloneID.id()); // 100​
​
​var cruiseID = createIdForActionCelebs [1];
console.log(cruiseID.id()); // 101


Use With the condtional Operator

The use of the IIFE in this manner is not as well known, but it quite powerful since you can execute complex logic without having to setup and call a named function:

— Note the two anonymous functions in the conditional statement
— Why would you do this? Because it is powerful and badass.
— I purposely added enough space between each section so the code can read better.






SQL  Query:

1. right join vs right out join
        table left table right
    - right join performs a join starting from right-most
    - returns all records from right table, and matched records form left
    - result is NULL from left side if there is no match
    - right join and right out join are same
2. full join vs union
    - full join returns all matching records from both tables whether the other matches or not
    - full join  and full outer join are same
3. left joing vs left out join
    - left join performs a join starting from left-most
    - returns all records from left table, and matched records from the right.
    - result is NULL from right side if there is no match

 4. Inner join 
    - return all records that are matching value in both tables
